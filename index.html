                <h2 class="text-center">About Fertility Preservation</h2>
                <p>Fertility preservation in general, and egg freezing in particular, is quickly becoming a more and more popular procedure for women each year. As more and more fertility centers are adopting the technology, increasing numbers of women are understanding the reproductive options they have and opting to take the necessary precautions to make sure that they will be able to create a family when they are ready, even if that time is not now.</p>
                <p>Women are born with all of their eggs. These eggs gradually mature and ovulate over their lifetime. Years of aging and environmental damage will decrease the egg quality over time. It is not difficult for women to get pregnant after 40 as long as the egg is young. Freezing young, healthy eggs can eliminate the pressure of family planning while you focus on your career and personal life. Breakthroughs in fertility preservation technology are allowing women to bank healthy eggs prior to medical treatments that may affect their fertility</p>
                <p><strong>Why is it important for me to freeze my eggs now?</strong><br />
                When it comes to your fertility, it is never too soon to begin planning for the future. The younger your eggs are when trying to conceive, the better chance you will have of getting pregnant. If you know that one day you would like to become a mother but feel that now is just not the time, we recommend freezing your eggs.</p>
                <p><strong>How do I know what type of cycle is right for me?</strong><br />
                New Hope Fertility takes each person’s unique physiology into consideration. Our doctors will create a customized treatment plan for your egg freezing cycle during your initial consultation.</p>
                <p><strong>How much does it cost to freeze my eggs? Will I be charged a yearly fee?</strong><br />
                One cycle of egg freezing is $7,200 plus medication costs which will vary depending on your treatment plan. For example, if you choose a natural cycle, there are no medication costs. We offer complimentary storage for 6 months at the end of your first egg banking. After 6 months, the storage fee is $1,200 a year.</p>
                <p><strong>How long can my eggs be frozen for?</strong><br />
                Oocytes (eggs) can be frozen indefinitely.</p>
                <p><strong>How long does each egg freezing cycle take?</strong><br />
                Every woman’s cycle varies but the approximate duration is about two weeks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hundreds of women have cryopreserved more than 8,000 eggs at our center over the past 10 years.</strong></p>
                    <p>New Hope Fertility Center is not only one of the largest Egg Freezing centers in the United States with an extensive donor egg bank, it has also been an early US pioneer for Oocyte (Egg) Freezing through the most advanced freezing technology, called Vitrification. In October 2005, New Hope delivered the first baby, born from an egg frozen through vitrification in New York. This was, in fact, the first successful procedure performed on the East Coast, and New Hope has gone on to become the trusted clinic for Oocyte Vitrification in the United States. Our unique process has been refined over the past 10 years to make our procedures more successful and gentler on your body. </p>

                    	<li>Our unique, natural approach to fertility preservation reduces stress on your body, compared to other centers’ high-dose stimulation.</li>
